# 2022_SIS_Team2 Application

## firebase_key.json File Removed
I have deleted the file for this, due to the leaked service account credentials 😅.
Need to add the file in the root project directory. It will no longer be published on GitHub, as it's in the .gitignore 😁

## Disabled Vision API
Since the project has been completed, I have disabled the vision api, so the landmark will no longer be detected if you decide to run the application. 😬
